#Please import **ActionBarSherlock Library**

If you want to build this app from source code, **You must import ActionBarSherlock Library**.

When you import the library, please set the name *`ActionBarSherlockLibrary`*  into library name to prevent confliction.
___
#### Why the ActionBarSherlock?
We chose [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/) library to provide [GDLive app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.proinlab.gdlapp) for more developers & users. 

By this integration, the project got more capability to lower version Android devices above Gingerbread 2.3.3 (sdk 8+) without loss of design functionality.
